8 COUNT BASIC
</dt>
<dd class='col-md-9 col-xs-12 text-truncate'>
The first figure usually taught to beginning students after the walking steps. The 8 count basic includes elements which are used throughout the dance, although the complete figure itself is not much used socially. The name refers to counts in music, however, the man is not constrained to rigidly mark a step on each count or beat of the rhythm. He is free to hold or to syncopate, or cut the beat, as the music moves him or as space on the floor around him allows. Also the figure may be danced into or out of at various points and is not always entered at the beginning. There are also shortcuts within the 8 count basic. For instance, the man may lead the lady from the cruzada at 5 directly to 2, or he may close his left foot to his right without weight on 7 and step side left directly to 2. So in actuality the positions which the dancers move through at each step are numbered as reference points. In closed dance position, they are as follows; * The man steps back right, the lady forward left. Or, variations: the man settles his weight on his right leg, placing the lady on her left, and holds. Also, the man may settle on his right leg, placing the lady on her left, quickly extending his left leg to his left side to point then closing back to his right leg without weight, as the lady mirrors his action with her right leg. Or the man may step through with his right leg between the partners, leading the lady to mirror his action (espejo) by stepping through with her left leg, remaining in closed position although briefly resembling promenade position.
The man steps side left, the lady side right, with the man stepping slightly further than the lady. The man steps forward right in outside right position keeping his upper body turned toward the lady in contra-body, the lady back left paralleling the man and also in contra-body. This is a common point of entry to the figure which the ladies should be aware of. The man steps forward left, the lady back right stretching slightly more and seeking the man�s center. The man closes his right foot to his left with weight and rotates his upper body to face forward, leading the lady to cross her left foot in front of her right with weight (cruzada) as she finishes moving back in front of the man. Many variations for the lady begin from this position. The man steps forward left inside his partner (to her center), the lady back right. The man steps side right, the lady side left. The man closes his left foot to his right with weight, the lady her right foot to her left.
Steps 1 through 3 (sometimes 1 through 5) are known as the salida. Steps 3 through 5 are known as "walking the lady to the cross". Steps 6 through 8 are known as [resolucion].

Sometimes spelled [Voleo]. Is a movement which appears to throw the working leg in a circular motion. For example, a back boleo can be executed by pivoting the supporting leg (say R) one direction (CCW) while extended the working foot (L) back, then quickly changing directions, pivoting CW on the standing leg (R) before the working foot has completed the extension back. This creates its characteristic whip effect. If the working foot is lifted during the pivot CW, this is considered a high boleo which adds to the appearance of a circular motion. A front boleo can be executed by pivoting the supporting leg (say R) one direction (CW) while extended the working foot (L) front, then quickly changing directions pivoting CCW on the standing leg (R), while lifting the L foot during the pivot. To execute the front and back boleo's simultaneously, it is necessary to join the feet immediately afer each boleo.

<dd class='col-md-9 col-xs-12 text-truncate'>
Eight (pl. ochos); Figure eights A crossing and pivoting figure from which the fan in American tango is derived. Executed as a walking step with flexed knees and feet together while pivoting, ochos may be danced either forward or backward and are so designated from the lady's perspective. El Ocho is considered to be one of the oldest steps in tango along with caminada, the walking steps. It dates from the era when women wore floor length skirts with full petticoats and danced on dirt floors. Since the lady's footwork could not be directly observed the quality of her dancing was judged by the figure she left behind in the dirt after she danced away.

<dd class='col-md-9 col-xs-12 text-truncate'>
Scissor A movement, usually danced by the man, in which an extended leg is withdrawn and crossed in front of the supporting leg without weight so that it remains free for the next step or movement. May also refer to a figure in which the man steps forward in outside position (left or right) caressing the outside of the lady's leg with his leg (as in 3 of basico), then crosses behind himself which pushes the lady's leg to cross in front. May also refer to a jumping step from stage tango where the lady swings her legs up and over with the second leg going up as the first leg is coming down (frequently seen as an aerial entry to sentadas).
