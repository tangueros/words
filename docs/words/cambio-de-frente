<p>Change of Front.</p>

<p>Simply involves facing a new direction.
However, some teachers use the term to specifically refer to a
particular method of turning for the leader in which he pivots
both feet CW (or both feet CCW) at the same time.</p>

<p>For a 90 degree turn, he begins in parada position and
pivots until he stands straight with both feet apart
(or vice versa start standing, end in parada position).</p>

<p>For a 180 turn, he begins in parada position, reaches
standing position at 90 degrees but continues turning until
he is once again in the parada position.</p>

<p>Frequently accompanies the woman&rsquo;s molinete, this effect
creates an interesting cadence in her movement</p>
