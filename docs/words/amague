<p>From amagar - To make a threatening motion as a feint</p>

<p>An amague is used as an embellishment either led or done on
one&rsquo;s own, and may be used before taking a step.
An example of an amague may be a beat ([frappe]) before
taking a step.</p>

<p>Sometimes called a [Saludo], it is a woman&rsquo;s embellishment
similar to a &lsquo;frappe&rsquo; (beating motion) in ballet.
It involves quickly crossing one leg in front of, or
behind the other, before taking a step.</p>
