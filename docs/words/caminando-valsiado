<p>A crossing and walking step which the man initiates at
3 of basico as he steps forward right in outside right
position, pivoting to his right on his right foot and
leading the lady to pivot on her left foot,
stepping side left (side right for the lady) and
drawing his right leg
under him with weight (the lady mirroring with her left).
The man then steps forward left in outside left position,
pivoting to the left on his left foot,
stepping side right and drawing his
left foot under him with weight (as the lady dances the
natural opposite).
The man returns to outside right position and either
continues the figure or walks the lady to the cross.
May be danced in tango or vals.</p>
