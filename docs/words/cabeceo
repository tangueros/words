<p>From cabeza; head</p>

<p>Traditional technique for selecting dance partners from a
distance at the milongas in Buenos Aires,
by using eye contact and head movements.</p>

<p>The cabeceo makes the invitation to dance less stressful as
it allows the invited person to decline discretely.</p>

<p>Non-verbal cues are frequently used.</p>

<p>So, as you are getting ready to ask someone to dance,
try to catch their eye, smile and nod.</p>

<p>You might raise your eyebrows in an inquiring expression or
directing a nod towards the dance floor.</p>

<p>Observe their body language. For instance, if you make
eye-contact and the other person quickly turns away,
pretends not to see you, or busies themselves in some way,
it means they do not want to dance.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if your potential partner returns
your eye-contact with a smile and / or a nod, you are
encouraged to invite them verbally
(ie. &ldquo;would you like to dance?&rdquo;).</p>

<p>When inviting a person who is in the presence of their
significant other, it is courteous to ask their
significant other for permission.</p>

<p>Be friendly but not flirtatious and avoid dance moves that
are sexually suggestive.</p>

<p>Avoid monopolizing anyoneâ€™s partner with multiple [tandas]</p>
