<p>A figure in which the man places the lady on one foot with
a lifting action of his frame and then dances around her
while keeping her centered over, and pivoting on, her
supporting leg.</p>

<p>Sometimes referred to as the [Stork].</p>

<p>A movement in which the man leans the lady&rsquo;s axis on his and
